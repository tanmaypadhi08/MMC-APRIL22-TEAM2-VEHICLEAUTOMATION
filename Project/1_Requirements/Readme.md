## ABSTRACT

Water tank overflow is a common problem which leads to the wastage of water. This circuit will detect the water level and will turn the lever on or off depending on the level. 
Water level indicator is a modern way of measuring the water level using latest technologies like sensors, Arduino. The main aim of the project is to observe the water level at 
any instant of time using Arduino, Servo Motor and Ultrasonic sensor to make it possible. As the servo motor used as an actuator will turn off when the tank fulls with water so 
that the water will not overflow. This may be useful in saving water from getting waste.

## Requirements

## HIGH LEVEL REQUIREMENTS

|ID |Description |
|--|-------------|
|01|Servo motor should ON/OFF|
|02|Ultrasonic Sensor should sense the level of water|
|03|LED should glow|
|04|Voltmeter should measure the voltage|

## LOW LEVEL REQUIREMENTS

|ID |Description |
|--|-------------|
|01|Servo motor valve should be open when the water is less.|
|02|Servo motor valve should close when water is full.|
|03|LED should glow when valve is open/close|
|04|Potentiometer should regulate the voltage properly.|
